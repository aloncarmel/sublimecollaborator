sublimecollaborator
===================

This is a small plugin i wrote when i tried to kick start devunity again. its a python plugin for sublime text editor that lets you share your code in real time with a server. its not done but its something.

* Can be used to create a tracking list for all dev activities for developers.
* Can be used to create a collaboration engine
* Can be used to share knowledge between developers on one central server.
